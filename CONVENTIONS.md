# Conventions

*Naming*

* Use descriptive and meaningful names for your microservices that convey their responsibility or domain.

* Using nouns or noun phrases to name your services.

* Use a suffix like ".Service" to indicate that a project represents a microservice.

* Use suffixes like "Controller" for API controllers or "Repository" for data repositories.

* Use lowercase letters and hyphens ("-") to separate words in API endpoint names.

* Use plural nouns to represent collections (e.g., "/orders" instead of "/order").

* (According to SOLID) Every class should have single responsibility. Convey this responsibility in the comment above the class. 

* Use Design Patterns where it is possible. Class name should include patterns name as a suffix.
